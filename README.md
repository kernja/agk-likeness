# LIKENESS

Written in App Game Kit Classic (v1.7), LIKENESS was heavily inspired by the game [4 Pics 1 Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Pics_1_Word). 

The game has 70 rounds. For each round, players start by spelling a word that describes two images. When the right word is chosen, a third image is added and the players must guess again. This continues on with a fourth image, and then a new round is started.
